## Priority Opportunities

### 1. Unified Partnership Dashboard (Shared Everything) 🎯
**Quadrant:** Quick Win (Low Effort, High Impact)

**Pain Point:**
Jenna and Derek have zero shared visibility. Physical wall calendar that Jenna photographs daily. Derek has "little notes on just pieces of paper everywhere" causing Jenna anxiety. Double-bookings occurring (Christmas party vs band booking). "Sometimes I don't know the event that's going on at the bar until I physically look at the calendar." Tuesday payroll = "scramble to get things from three different places." Information silos preventing effective partnership. "Is he going to move to Germany with you?" - relationship strain is real.

**Opportunity:**
Single shared dashboard (Google Sheets or Excel + shared folder) with tabs for: (1) Shared calendar (bar events + catering color-coded), (2) Bills due tracker, (3) Payroll information, (4) Revenue/expense summary, (5) Staff schedule. Both partners can update from anywhere. Auto-syncs. Printable for Jenna's physical preference. Jenna can still photograph calendar, but Derek sees it digitally instantly. Replaces scattered paper notes and calendar photos.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Complexity: Low (Excel/Google Sheets template design + shared access setup)
- Dependencies: Choose platform (Google Sheets for real-time sync recommended), design layout, train both partners, migrate current calendar

**Estimated Value:**
- Time savings: 3-5 hours/week saved on coordination meetings and information gathering
- Revenue impact: Zero double-bookings = prevent revenue loss and customer disappointment
- Strategic value: **Business-critical** - current system will catastrophically fail at new venue scale, preserves partnership relationship

**ROI:** Immediate (prevents first double-booking in Week 1)

### 2. Automated Receipt Capture & Real-Time Expense Tracking 🎯
**Quadrant:** Quick Win (Low Effort, High Impact)

**Pain Point:**
Jenna hates accounting "with a passion." Receipts "falling out everywhere" from purse. Manual Excel entry: date, expense account, pre-tax, tax, total. Takes "a couple hours" to catch up when neglected (procrastination is significant). Nightmares about disorganized receipts. 2 hours/week minimum when maintained. Delayed financial visibility = can't make real-time purchasing decisions ("I'll just run out and buy chicken at Superstore when I could have gotten it at Sobeys for cheaper"). Tried QuickBooks but couldn't separate food (no tax) vs non-food (taxed) items.

**Opportunity:**
Implement Expensify (iOS app, ~$5/month) with AI-powered receipt scanning. Snap photo instantly after purchase - auto-extracts date, vendor, amount. Custom categories for Nova Scotia tax rules (food/no tax vs supplies/taxed). Real-time expense dashboard visible to both Jenna & Derek. Export to accountant annually. Eliminates manual Excel entry completely. AI handles categorization - Jenna just reviews and confirms.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Time: 2-3 weeks
- Complexity: Low-Medium (Expensify setup + Nova Scotia tax category testing)
- Dependencies: Verify Expensify handles Nova Scotia tax rules, create custom categories, train Jenna on photo workflow, migrate existing Excel data

**Estimated Value:**
- Time savings: 2 hours/week = 104 hours annually
- Revenue impact: $2,000-3,000 annual value (time freed for revenue activities) + better purchasing decisions from real-time visibility
- Strategic value: Eliminates procrastination-causing pain point, reduces stress/nightmares, financial transparency for both partners

**ROI:** 2-3 month payback on subscription and setup time

### 3. Dedicated Catering Email + Qualification Form System
**Quadrant:** Easy Win (Low Effort, Medium Impact)

**Pain Point:**
Catering inquiries go to info@eastcoastcommune (Derek's inbox) → Derek forwards to Jenna → Jenna manually asks qualifying questions (party size, date, service type) → sends appropriate menu → back-and-forth via email thread → Jenna writes everything on physical paper. Takes 15-20 minutes per lead × 2-5 leads/week = 1-2 hours weekly. No visibility into who saw what. Can't handle >50 people with current household stove - wastes time on incompatible requests. Recent week had 7 catering gigs - volume growing fast.

**Opportunity:**
Create dedicated catering@eastcoastcommune email. Auto-respond with qualification form asking: party size, date, venue vs off-site, budget range, menu preferences, special requests. Form responses auto-route >50 people to "incompatible" email template. Auto-send appropriate menu (venue/off-site/appetizers) based on selections. Centralized tracking sheet (printable for Jenna) with all gig details. Integration with partnership dashboard calendar.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Time: 2-3 weeks
- Complexity: Low (Google Forms or Typeform + email routing + calendar integration)
- Dependencies: Set up catering@ email, create qualification form with conditional logic, design menu delivery automation, create tracking sheet template

**Estimated Value:**
- Time savings: 10-15 minutes per lead × 2-5 leads/week = 30-75 minutes weekly
- Revenue impact: Faster qualification = capture more time-sensitive bookings, filter incompatible leads before time investment
- Strategic value: Dedicated inbox clarity, scalable as catering business grows, maintains Jenna's ability to handle custom requests

**ROI:** 2-3 month payback on setup time

### 4. Automated Catering Menu Delivery Based on Form Responses
**Quadrant:** Easy Win (Low Effort, Medium Impact)

**Pain Point:**
After qualification questions, Jenna manually sends one of three menus (venue service, off-site catering, appetizers/grazing) based on customer needs. Requires reviewing email thread, determining appropriate menu, attaching file, sending. Specialty requests require additional back-and-forth and judgment calls. All manual, all time-consuming.

**Opportunity:**
Form automation that auto-sends appropriate menu PDF based on form selections (venue type → venue menu, off-site → off-site menu, appetizers only → grazing menu). Include "special requests" field that flags for Jenna's manual review. Auto-confirmation email with menu attached, pricing expectations, next steps. Reduces Jenna's involvement to specialty cases only - everything else automatic.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Complexity: Low (form conditional logic + email templates + PDF attachments)
- Dependencies: Create polished menu PDFs, set up automated email responses, test conditional routing

**Estimated Value:**
- Time savings: 5-10 minutes per standard inquiry × ~70% of leads = significant weekly reclaim
- Revenue impact: Instant menu delivery = professional experience, faster customer decision-making
- Strategic value: Scales infinitely - can handle 50 inquiries/week same as 5 inquiries/week

**ROI:** 1-2 month payback on setup time

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Build unified partnership dashboard (critical for venue opening, prevents relationship strain)
2. **This Month:** Set up Expensify receipt automation + catering qualification system
3. **Next Quarter:** Optimize menu delivery automation after catering volume stabilizes in new venue

## Deprioritized Items

**Grocery Shopping Price Comparison System:**
- **Why deprioritized:** Actual savings unclear - "not cheaper by $5, it's cheaper by a dollar." Jenna estimates $50/month savings is "almost not worth the time." Time investment unknown, never measured. Jenna hates digital shopping tools ("I hate being on my phone"). ROI uncertain - better to measure actual savings over one month before investing in solution. Low-priority compared to business-threatening partnership coordination issues and 2-hour weekly accounting pain.

**Derek's Note-Taking System:**
- **Why deprioritized:** Contributing to information silos but less quantified impact than partnership dashboard. Solve dashboard first - if Derek has centralized system to input information, scattered paper notes may naturally resolve. Revisit if dashboard doesn't solve this symptom.
